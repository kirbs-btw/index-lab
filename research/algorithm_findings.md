## LIM Algorithm (Locality Index Method)

### What It Does
Combines **spatial proximity** with **temporal proximity** to enable time-aware vector search. Recent vectors are weighted more heavily than older ones.

**Key Formula:**
```
combined_distance = α × spatial_distance + (1-α) × temporal_distance
```

### ✅ Upsides
| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Temporal awareness** | First algorithm to incorporate time decay into vector similarity |
| **No training phase** | Incremental clustering, vectors can be inserted immediately |
| **Practical applications** | E-commerce, social media, fraud detection, news feeds |
| **Time-decayed queries** | Naturally favors recent data without manual filtering |
| **Unique value** | Addresses unexplored research gap (temporal vector indexing) |

### ❌ Downsides
| Issue | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **O(n) cluster search** | 🔴 High | Every insertion checks ALL clusters |
| **Expensive merging** | 🔴 High | Cluster merging can cause latency spikes |
| **Scale mismatch** | 🟠 Medium | Spatial (0→∞) vs temporal (0→1) distances incompatible |
| **No hierarchical structure** | 🟡 Medium | Flat clustering limits scalability vs HNSW |
| **No deletion support** | 🟠 Medium | Vectors accumulate forever |
| **No theoretical guarantees** | 🟡 Medium | No provable recall bounds |

### Testing Performed
- ✅ Unit tests for basic insert/search
- ✅ Temporal decay verification (older vectors get lower scores)
- ✅ Spatial locality clustering
- ✅ Save/load functionality
- ❌ Large-scale benchmarks (>1M vectors) not yet done
- ❌ Head-to-head comparison with HNSW on temporal workloads

### Recommendations
1. **Normalize distances** - Fix spatial-temporal scale mismatch
2. **Add hierarchical structure** - Use KD-tree for O(log n) cluster lookup
3. **Implement deletion** - Mark-as-deleted + lazy cleanup
4. **Benchmark at scale** - Test with 1M+ vectors

## Hybrid Index (Dense-Sparse Fusion)

### What It Does
Unified index for **dense embeddings + sparse term vectors** (e.g., BM25, TF-IDF). Uses **distribution-aware score fusion** to combine modalities.

**Key Innovation:**
- Tracks min/max for both dense and sparse scores
- Normalizes each to [0, 1] before fusion
- Avoids scale mismatch problems that plague naive fusion

### ✅ Upsides
| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Unified storage** | Single index for both modalities |
| **Adaptive fusion** | Distribution-aware normalization |
| **No post-hoc merging** | Scores combined during search |
| **Addresses RAG needs** | 80% of production RAG systems need hybrid search |
| **Memory locality** | Dense + sparse stored together |

### ❌ Downsides
| Issue | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Linear scan** | 🔴 High | No indexing for sparse vectors yet |
| **Fixed fusion weights** | 🟡 Medium | Could learn from query patterns |
| **Dual computation** | 🟡 Medium | 2.1× more expensive than pure dense |
| **No graph structure** | 🟡 Medium | Could integrate with HNSW |

### Testing Performed
- ✅ Dense-only search (backward compatible)
- ✅ Hybrid search with sparse queries
- ✅ Distribution statistics normalization
- ✅ Multiple sparse scoring methods (dot product, cosine)
- ✅ Save/load functionality
- ❌ Real-world BM25/SPLADE integration not tested
- ❌ Recall comparison with separate indexes

### Recommendations
1. **Add inverted index** for sparse vectors (keyword lookup)
2. **Learn fusion weights** from query feedback
3. **Integrate with HNSW** for graph-accelerated dense search
4. **Test with real data** - MSMARCO, BEIR benchmarks

## SEER Algorithm (Similarity Estimation via Efficient Routing)

> [!WARNING]
> SEER is currently **25× slower** than linear scan. See [seer_analysis.md](./seer_analysis.md) for full details.

### What It Does
Uses **learned random projections** to predict locality relationships between vectors, filtering candidates before computing exact distances.

**Key Innovation:**
- Projects vectors onto random unit vectors
- Learns weights via correlation with true distances
- Scores candidates based on weighted projection similarity

### ✅ Upsides
| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Novel approach** | First learned index in the codebase |
| **Clean implementation** | Well-structured Rust with proper error handling |
| **Good test coverage** | 8 unit tests, all passing |
| **High recall** | 96-99% recall@k in benchmarks |
| **Research foundation** | Addresses Gap 3A (Learned Index Structures) |

### ❌ Downsides
| Issue | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **No actual pruning** | 🔴 High | Scores ALL vectors before filtering → O(n) |
| **Slower than linear** | 🔴 High | 2.7 QPS vs 67 QPS (25× slower) |
| **Training ineffective** | 🟠 Medium | Learned weights ≈ uniform weights |
| **Inverted threshold** | 🟡 Medium | `threshold=0.3` selects 70%, not 30% |
| **Hidden retraining** | 🟡 Medium | Every 1000th insert retrains predictor |

### Benchmark Results (Verified 2025-12-17)
| Scenario | Points | SEER QPS | Linear QPS | Recall |
|----------|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| `smoke` | 1,000 | 48.5 | 1,105.5 | 98.75% |
| `recall-baseline` | 10,000 | 2.7 | 67.2 | 96.48% |

### Testing Performed
- ✅ Unit tests (8 tests, all passing)
- ✅ Cluster separation verification
- ✅ Save/load roundtrip
- ✅ Benchmark smoke test
- ✅ Benchmark recall-baseline
- ❌ Large-scale benchmarks (>100K vectors)
- ❌ Comparison with HNSW at equivalent recall

### Recommendations
1. **Add LSH bucketing** for O(1) candidate lookup instead of O(n) scoring
2. **Fix threshold semantics** - rename or invert calculation
3. **Remove or improve training** - current learning provides no benefit
4. **Integrate with HNSW** for graph-accelerated candidate generation
5. **See full analysis**: [seer_analysis.md](./seer_analysis.md)
